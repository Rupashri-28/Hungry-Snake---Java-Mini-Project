# Hungry Snake - Java Mini Project
 Java Mini Project - "Hungry Snake" is a classic snake game. The player controls a snake that navigates within a confined area, consuming randomly appearing apples. Each time the snake eats an apple, its tail grows in length, adding complexity and challenge to the gameplay. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the window edges.
